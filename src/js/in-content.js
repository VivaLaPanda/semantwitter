/* in-content.js
*
* This file has an example on how to communicate with other parts of the extension through a long lived connection (port) and also through short lived connections (chrome.runtime.sendMessage).
*
* Note that in this scenario the port is open from the popup, but other extensions may open it from the background page or not even have either background.js or popup.js.
